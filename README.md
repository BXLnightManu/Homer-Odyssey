# Homer-Odyssey

Homerâ€™s Odyssey is an expedition that follows an underlying thread. That is to say an expedition in which each quest starts with the code made during the preceding one.

This Odyssey will lead you through remote regions of web applications such as ReactJS, NodeJS API Rest and databases. By the end of the journey, you will have created a blog dedicated to traveling. Woohoo!
